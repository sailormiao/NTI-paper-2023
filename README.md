# NTI-paper-2023
This repository is created to include data-related files for the NTI annual biosecurity competition in 2023.
The data used for this project comes from the Nuclear Threat Initiative and do not belong to me: https://www.ghsindex.org/report-model/. The data from "OECD.csv" comes from https://data.oecd.org/rd/gross-domestic-spending-on-r-d.htm. Please consult NTI and OECD for more information. 
This repository not only includes the necessary data documents but also the R output in the form of an html document, which is the same as the appendix.
